First trial to creat a repository !

SoixanteSix is a student majoring in AI,his current interest is in Visual Object Tracking & Deep Learning.

Choosing KCF as his Graduation Design Topic,he is reading papers and adoring Big Cows in this field,Visual Object Tracking.Before Graduation, he must be familiar with work-of-art VOT algorithms before 2018CVPR(actually he wishes to).Luckily most of these works has open-sourced their codes & projects,so understanding and remembering and being creative become his essential duty.

Moreover,DeepLearning is not a soft bone to chew.Massive references require Sufficient efforts to be devoted.

To make full preparation for next stage study,this boy who lacks practical skills,must learn how to config Caffe/OpenCV,how to install Lunix/Ubuntu and use them and so on.his programming skills is degrading as well,so enhance it!
